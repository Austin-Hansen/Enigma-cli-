    std::string raw_str= R"( Enigma is a type of substitution cypher used by  Germany
     from the 1920s to late world war 2, It is not a computer but an electro mechanical rotor cipher machine.
     It came in at least 12 official forms, the first one being made in 1918.
     The first progress in cracking the code was achieved by Marian Rejewski,a Polish mathematician and cryptanalyst, using the theory of permutations.
     The Poles managed to solve the plugboard portion of the code after some good guess work, and getting a key from a French spy. Using bombes,a type of proto computer, they were able to figure out part of the enigma used by the diplomats of Germany, however the war caught up to them, and they and their techniques were extradited to the United Kingdom, where they shared their techniques, and where turing would build the first real computer.
